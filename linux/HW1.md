## Task: _Linux Scripting_

### Objectives:

**_Application Deployment Script:_**

The repository https://github.com/Manisha-Bayya/simple-django-project contains an example application that can be used as the basis for this task. You may choose any sample application for this task; however, it is expected that the deployment complexity would be similar.

Develop a Python or Bash script that automates the steps mentioned in the README.md file from the application repository. Steps concerning global installation of MySQL and a specific version of Python can be skipped.

**_Requirements for script:_**

- Compatible with RHEL-like \ Debian-like \ Ubuntu-like Linux distros
- Download and extract the specified version of the application source code. It is preferable to pass this version of information to your script as an argument or a key (as in a kind of argument ) and respectful value instead of hardcoding it.
- Check if prerequisites like database and interpreter are available in the system and if their versions are compatible with the application.

**_Submission Guidelines:_**

Submit your code file with the appropriate code styling, linting, basic testing, and documentation.
Ensure that you provide clear instructions for setting up and running your code, including the activation of the virtual environment and dependency installation.
